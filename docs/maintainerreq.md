# To become an official maintainer of PixelOS:

Before you apply to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few things:

**Any failure in following the instructions given below will make you unfit for the maintainership. No questions asked.**

- You **MUST** own the device. Blind and untested builds aren't allowed. Devices that have minimal hardware difference from yours are allowed to be maintained, as long as you maintain your own device too.

- You **MUST** have a good knowledge of git.

- You **MUST** create and maintain an unofficial build for some amount of time, (Don't instantly make a build and apply. That'll mean an instant rejection), make sure that the build is stable for daily usage before applying. The context of stability may differ for different devices, so explain regarding any exceptions.

- You **MUST** have your device sources available publicly with proper authorship for each commit.

- You must show the **real** device sources being used.
