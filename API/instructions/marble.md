# Keep in mind...
- DO NOT USE any other recovery than TWRP recovery which is linked in the XDA thread.
- YOU MUST CLEAN FLASH IF:
    - You are coming from any other ROM or MIUI
    - You are coming from previous Android Version
- Magisk should only be flashed after booting once into the ROM. Do not flash Magisk along with the ROM package
- Do not flash Hyper OS firmware. Use the latest available MIUI firmware.

- If you face issues like poor RAM management or storage issues, you have not followed the instructions and/or have changed kernel/recovery. STRICTLY follow the instructions provided again before reporting any issues.

# Clean Flash (coming from a different ROM)
Clean flash involves formatting data which means you will be loosing data stored in the internal storage of your device, data in SD Card should not be affected. I will not be responsible for any loss of data.
- Download ROM
- Reboot the device to Recovery mode by powering off the device and then by holding Power button and Volume UP key together
- Wipe dalvik cache, Cache, Data
- Flash the ROM
- Make sure to enable the checkbox "Automatically reflash Twrp after flashing a Rom"
- Flash Firmware
- Reboot and voila!

# Dirty Flash / Update
There will be no loss of data if everything goes well. Keep backups incase of any mishap. I will not be responsible for any loss of data.
- Download ROM file to your computer
- Reboot the device to recovery
- Flash the ROM
- Flash the firmware if you are not on the latest firmware
- Reboot and voila!
