# Keep in mind...
This ROM comes with EROFS formatting, due to which:
- Do NOT change kernel
- System is Read-Only (restricts making changes to overlays, system APKs, etc. directly, however you can replace stuff with Magisk)
- Avoid using any other recovery than PixelOS recovery or the given OrangeFox recovery which is included (If you wish to use, check for EROFS compatibility)
- YOU MUST CLEAN FLASH IF:
    - You are coming from any other ROM or MIUI
    - You are coming from May 2022 Update or before

# Clean flash:
- Flash recovery (link is above)
- Download ROM from the link above
- Reboot to recovery
- Flash the latest  MIUI 13 firmware for your region
- Flash ROM zip
- Format data
- Reboot and voila!

# Updating to a newer build (dirty flash):
- Update via OTA Updater, or
- Flash ROM zip (sideload)
- Reboot and voila!
